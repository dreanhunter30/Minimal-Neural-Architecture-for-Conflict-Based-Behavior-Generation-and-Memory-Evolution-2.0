# NeuroATM: Emergent Cognitive Behavior in a Minimal Agent

**Author:** Bato Naidanov  
**Keywords:** artificial cognition, minimal neural agent, conflict resolution, adaptive behavior

## Overview

This project demonstrates a minimal neural agent that evolves behavior through internal conflict resolution. It generates new actions—called "third paths"—when known patterns fail to respond adequately.

- The core system is implemented in: `NeuroATMv2_ThirdPath_Final.ipynb`
- Red conflict points are tracked as emergent decisions
- Memory grows over time based on novel solutions

## Files

- `NeuroATMv2_ThirdPath_Final.ipynb` — Main notebook demonstrating the agent’s evolving responses.
- `README.md` — This file.
- `screenshots/` — Visual logs of the agent’s behavior and memory expansion from multiple runs.
- `paper_summary.txt` — Short explanation of how and why this system matters.

## Summary

This is not a large AI system. It is a micro-experiment to explore how behavior can emerge when there is no answer.  
Where deep learning requires massive data, **this model grows from contradiction**.
